dotCMS
Version: 4.1.1

Vulnerability Type:
==========================
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)


Vulnerability Details:
=====================
Application is vulnerable to stored XSS within multiple sections of the application. The application does not 
sanitize user supplied input and renders injected javascript code to the users browsers. 
Attackers use this vulnerability to inject malicious javascript code such as a malicious redirect, 
crypto currency mining, or exploit kit.


Replication:
=====================
1) Navigate to the following example pages:
  - https://demo.dotcms.com/dotAdmin/#/c/vanity-urls -- Title parameter
  - https://demo.dotcms.com/dotAdmin/#/c/containers -- Description parameter
  - https://demo.dotcms.com/dotAdmin/#/c/templates -- Description parameter

2) Each of these areas of the application allow for unsanitized input to be supplied by a user.
The following payload was utilized in the testing: <svg/onload=alert('XSS')>.

3) Perform the normal function within the application to create a new "Vanity URL, Container, or Template" 
inserting the payload into the specific parameter location will trigger the vulnerability.


Remediation Details:
=====================
Prevent the application from rendering javascript supplied from the end user. 
Create a whitelist of allowed characters for each input field.
Sanitize user supplied input server side.
